To compile our project, the only command 
needed to use in the terminal is: 

> make

This will compile our files and create an executable named "compiler" for your testing.


To test code, use the standard UNIX commands to run and redirect input from your testfile

Example:

        ./compiler < test.ct > output.cms
        
This will create a output code file that can be then processed by the CMachine.
